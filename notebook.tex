\section{Problem Statement}\label{problem-statement}}

I'm trying to write a real-time (\textgreater{}= 30 FPS), specialized
OCR solution to gather player damage and match timer samples from the
Super Smash Brothers: Ultimate (SSBU) in-game HUD. The image below
identifies the text of interest with green rectangles.

The goal is to surface real-time time-series damage data and statistics
to Twitch stream viewers while the match unfolds. We've already
implemented such an end-to-end solution for one of SSBU's predecessors,
the web front-end for which lives at metascouter.gg.

The preexisting solution is for Super Smash Brothers: Melee (SSBM). For
SSBM I used some heuristics and simple thresholding to segment
individual digits. Each segment's would then undergo some normalization
before being scored with template matching against exemplar characters
for digits 0-9. The SSBU timer displayed in the upper-right corner of
the screen is consistently white-on-gray, so I believe I can re-use my
SSBM-purposed implementation in that instance. However, Ultimate's
player damage is newer and flashier. SSBU decorates its digits with more
movement, a variety of colors and on occasion, the digits partially
occlude one another. I've included some examples of this in the
following images.

\hypertarget{timeline-and-requirements}{%
\subsection{Timeline and requirements}\label{timeline-and-requirements}}

I'm to implement a production-ready solution for a major tournament on
February 2nd of 2019, and I'd ideally like some breathing room ahead of
that date. So, I'm looking to get something working quickly.

To simplify things under a short timeframe, text localization can be
done by manually selecting regions of interest at match-time. However, I
am interested in developing a very fast digit/text region localization
solution in the long term.

It's worth noting that our SSBM solution would filter digit sequence
values over a 12-frame window at 30FPS. This would allow for some
temporal consensus and a voting scheme would compensate for bad
readings. We'll be able to do the same here, so the per-frame accuracy
requirements don't need to be stellar. 90\% classification accuracy
\emph{over digit sequences} in all reasonable cases is my
currently-stated goal.

\hypertarget{approaches-to-the-problem}{%
\section{Approaches to the problem}\label{approaches-to-the-problem}}

I need some expert help in evaluating the sanity of some of these
possible solutions and quickly turning around experiments to inform
product-ready implementation decisions. I'm looking at two high-level
approaches at the moment:

\hypertarget{pixel-classifier-for-digit-segmentation-character-classification}{%
\subsection{1) Pixel classifier for digit segmentation + character
classification}\label{pixel-classifier-for-digit-segmentation-character-classification}}

\hypertarget{pixel-classification}{%
\subsubsection{Pixel classification}\label{pixel-classification}}

A solution which reliably segments digits for running through a digit
classifier would be great. I'm currently primarily examining this route
since it's similar to what I've done for SSBM, and we still have a fixed
``font'' of digit exemplar images to work against.

However, as I mentioned earlier the variation in color makes
segmentation more difficult than it was in SSBM and I haven't yet landed
on an acceptable solution to identify relevant pixels.

I've done some analysis on the volume of ``in-digit'' pixel values in
HSV color space, and there is definitely some structure (see below).
However I'm not certain of the best way to go about modeling that
structure.

Below this introduction you'll find some experimentation and results
using a Gaussian Naive Bayes classifier to identify ``in-digit'' pixels.
It's of course insufficient given that the target volume pictured above
can't be characterized by a single Gaussian distribution. The classifier
performs pretty well in a particular modality where pixel values are
clustered around yellow/orange though. At a glance that seems to
represent the center-of-mass of the plotted volume so I'm optimistic
about applying some kind of clustering and/or mixture model. I've also
thought about using decision trees to facilitate a highly parallel
approach to this problem, similar to the approach the Kinect team took
for human body-part classification. In addition to considering colors,
the features considered in a decision tree-based solution could include
some spatial information, or neighbor pixel colors as well.

\hypertarget{character-classification}{%
\subsubsection{Character
classification}\label{character-classification}}

Template matching worked in SSBM, but it was comparatively simple to get
very clean segments from relevant digits. It's not yet clear to me that
this will be possible in SSBU. Template matching is very sensitive to
any kind of morphological variance, so I may need a more robust digit
classifier.

In the past I've tried dividing digits up into sub-regions and
extracting features from those sub-regions to feed to an SVM. Template
matching still performed better though, so I tossed that aside.

Additional suggestions for digit classification as it applies to this
problem are very welcome.

\hypertarget{deep-learning}{%
\subsection{2) Deep learning}\label{deep-learning}}

While data collection, training and model tuning can be difficult and
complex, the end result of using a CNN-based solution could possibly
simplify our implementations considerably. A one-shot network which
produces digit sequences in real-time might be overkill for this
problem, but it also has the chance to be very robust and simple to
deploy in production.

I've looked over this paper several times, which details Google's
approach to digit sequence classification for building numbers
discovered in Google Street View photos. They effectively solve this
problem for Google's internal, much larger analog of SVHN using a CNN
with 8 convolutional layers and two fully connected layers. I'd like to
think that, given the improvements in CNN architectures since 2013 and
the much more constrained problem space for digit classification in
SSBU, that we could achieve adequate performance with a model shallow
enough to produce real-time results.

However, I've never built a CNN model on my own and would feel more
comfortable getting an expert's take on this assertion.
